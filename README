An attempt to use PhantomJS to test client-side code in Mojolicious apps

Design goals

(1) have the test script not depend on a running mojolicious server (ie start one, like Test::Mojo scripts can), whether that be from a js or perl file doesn't matter
(2) emit tap in a normal way in a manner that prove -l can collect tests
(3) not have to reimplement a large chunk of the test methods in either Test::More or Test::Mojo
  note: if tape has functionality like Test::* (that emits tap and can be collected subject to (1) and (2)) then that is sufficient
